FastAPI is a modern, high-performance Python web framework used to build APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) quickly using Python 3.8+ type hints.
It is currently one of the most trending backend frameworks due to speed, async support, and developer productivity.

🔥 Why FastAPI Is Trending
1️⃣ High Performance (Very Fast)

Built on ASGI (via Starlette + Uvicorn).

Benchmarks show it can outperform traditional frameworks like Django/Flask for async workloads.


2️⃣ Async Support (Modern Architecture)

Native async / await support.
Ideal for:
Real-time apps
Streaming
Chat systems
External API calls
Async architecture improves I/O performance significantly.

3️⃣ Automatic API Documentation

Generates docs automatically:

Swagger UI → /docs

ReDoc → /redoc

Based on OpenAPI standard.

👉 Saves frontend & testing time.

4️⃣ Type Validation (Pydantic)

Uses Python type hints + Pydantic.

Automatic:

Data validation

Serialization

Error handling

Reduces bugs & improves code quality.

5️⃣ Fast Growing Popularity
